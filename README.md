# LinkLoom

Welcome to LinkLoom—a simple, fast, and beautiful way to save and organize your bookmarks. Built for people who want a clean, dark-mode experience and powerful tagging, without the clutter.

## Why LinkLoom?

I built LinkLoom because I was tired of losing track of great links. With LinkLoom, you can quickly save, tag, and find your bookmarks from any device. It’s private, fast, and focused on what matters: your links.
